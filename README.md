# Who Am I?

98â€™ model -defined as gen-Z but feels as gen-Y more- human being. 

In the last 15 years, I tried to be a perfect consumer of entertainment and information. Nowadays, I am also trying to be a producer of this entertainment and information. I did some amateurish DJ stuff and live streams on Twitch and tried to catch up with computer programming. In early times of my college life, I met Carl Gustav Jung thanks to another great man. This acquaintance simplified the ways I understand different concepts in life. As someone who has a hard time understanding life and people, my interest in computer science and psychology helps me a lot. 

Thatâ€™s me, briefly.

# What I am Doing?

I am a Software Engineering student in Bahcesehir University, Ä°stanbul. In general perspective, I am trying to improve my knowledge in three main concepts that are programming, entertaining and understanding. 

Currently, I'm enhancing myself in the Flutter SDK, which I have a great love for. You can see some projects in my repositories.

# What I want to Do?

I am always named as a successful student in Turkish Educational System which is not great, sadly. When I had a computer for the first time, unlike most coders, I couldnâ€™t recognize that this could be programmable. As you can see, I was not that bright. I thought my biggest dream was to be a doctor since I was six years old, when I realized that my real dream is to help people and with my personal skills, the best way to achieve this dream is through engineering. When I decided to take the College Exam a second time, I clearly focused on being in the Software Engineering Department in Bahcesehir University.

I want to be a Software Engineer with high social skills that see peopleâ€™s problems and try to clear up. Mobile devices are so interesting to me, many times of our days go with them because of that I am so curious about mobile technologies. The social and creative side of my brain wants to feel like a Chef who serves experience, not just food. Jungian Psychology, Baudrillardâ€™s Simulacra ideas, Kantâ€™s philosophy and Game Theory whet my desire about games. I hope one day in the future I can offer people a good experience through games.
