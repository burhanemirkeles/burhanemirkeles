# Who Am I?

98â€™ model -defined as gen-Z but feels as gen-Y more- human being. 

In the last 15 years, I tried to be a perfect consumer of entertainment and information. Nowadays, I am also trying to be a producer of this entertainment and information. I did some amateurish DJ stuff and live streams on Twitch and tried to catch up with software development. In early times of my college life, I met Carl Gustav Jung thanks to another great man. This acquaintance simplified the ways I understand different concepts in life. As someone who has a hard time understanding life and people, my interest in computer science and psychology helps me a lot. 

Thatâ€™s me, briefly.

# What I am Doing?

Currently, I am working at Halkbank as a Junior iOS Developer. In general, I am trying to improve my knowledge in three main concepts that are programming, entertaining, and understanding.

# What I want to Do?

I am always named as a successful student in Turkish Educational System which is not great, sadly. When I had a computer for the first time, unlike most coders, I couldnâ€™t recognize that this could be programmable. As you can see, I was not that bright. I thought my biggest dream was to be a medical doctor since I was six years old, when I realized that my real dream is to help people and with my personal skills, the best way to achieve this dream is through engineering. When I decided to take the College Exam a second time, I clearly focused on being in the Software Engineering Department in Bahcesehir University.

I want to be an engineer with high social skills that see peopleâ€™s problems and try to clear up. Mobile devices are so interesting to me, many times of our days go with them because of that I am so curious about mobile technologies. The social and creative side of my brain wants to feel like a Chef who serves experience, not just food. Jungian Psychology, Baudrillardâ€™s Simulacra ideas, Kantâ€™s philosophy and Game Theory whet my desire about games. Hopefully, I want to work in mobile applications that serve large masses. I hope one day in the future I can offer people a good experience through games.
